title: AI Gateway
---

::: {.callout-important}

The AI Gateway is an experimental feature for Coder Workspaces.
An **API key is required** to use the gateway. 
Access is currently restricted to library staff.

:::

Coder Workspaces can use an AI Gateway (LiteLLM) for API access to large language models. 
The gateway is only accessible from your Coder Workspace.

The gateway URL is `http://litellm.dreamlab.ucsb.edu:4000`

## AI-assisted Coding Tools

Most AI-assisted coding tools can be configured to use the AI gateway.

### OpenCode

[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) is open-source coding agent that works with a
wide range of model providers. These instructions are from [LiteLLM's
OpenCodeQuickStart](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/tutorials/opencode_integration).

#### 1. Install OpenCode

```sh
# download and install opencode
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash

# apply updated $PATH
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### 2. Configure OpenCode

Configure OpenCode:

```sh
# create opencode config folder
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode

# edit the config file (opencode.json)
nano ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json
```

Paste the following into `nano` as the contents of `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "litellm": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/google",
      "name": "DREAM Lab LiteLLM Proxy",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "http://litellm.dreamlab.ucsb.edu:4000"
      },
      "models": {
        "gemini-3-flash-preview": {
          "name": "Gemini 3 Flash"
        },
        "gemini-3.1-pro-preview": {
        	"name": "Gemini 3.1 Pro"
        },
        "gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools": {
        	"name": "Gemini 3.1 Pro (Custom Tools)"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Save the file (`Ctrl + O`, then `Ctrl + X` in nano); then start OpenCode:

```sh
opencode
```

In OpenCode, enter `/connect` to start the **Connect a provider** configuration:

- Enter **DREAM Lab** in the search box, to filter the list to just the provider
we set in the configuration file. Press Enter to select the provider. 
- In the **API key** input, enter your personal API key and hit Enter.
- Hit enter again to select the model, **Gemini 3 Flash**
- You should now be back in OpenCode's main screen.Confirm that the connection is working with a simple question ("Are we connected?")

![OpenCode User Interface](../images/opencode.png)

Use `/exit` to quit OpenCode. The configured provider and model should persist
with your next session.


### Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) is Anthropic's coding
agent. It works primarily with Anthropic models (Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku), which
some users may have access to through the AI gateway. These instructions are
based on [Claude Code's
documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) for connecting to
a LiteLLM gateway.

#### 1. Install Claude Code

Start the terminal and install Claude Code if necessary:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

#### 2. Configure Claude Code

You need to set three environment variables so Claude Code can connect to
authenticate with the AI gateway. You can add these to the bottom of your
`~/.bashrc` file so they take effect automatically when you start the terminal.

Open `~/.bashrc` in a text editor:

```sh
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following lines. Replace
`"YOUR_API_KEY..."` with the key you received from DREAM Lab staff.

```sh
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR_API_KEY..."
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://litellm.dreamlab.ucsb.edu:4000
export CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_BETAS=1
```

Save the file (`Ctrl + O`, then `Ctrl + X` in nano) and reload it:

```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

By adding these variables to `~/.bashrc`, you won't need to enter the API
key or gateway address every time you log in to your Coder workspace.

#### 3. Start Claude Code

You should start Claude Code from inside a project directory:

```sh
claude
```

The workspace will ask if it's a safe environment. Select **"Yes, I trust
this folder"** and Claude will start.

Once Claude starts, try asking it a question. You do not need to run `/init`
like it says at the top.

::: {.callout-tip}

If you see a **Missing API Token** error in red to the right of the terminal,
you are not connected to Anthropic and will need to either set up the
environment variables in `~/.bashrc` (as described above) or exit Claude and
manually export the variables in your terminal session.

## LiteLLM API with curl

You can use curl to call the LiteLLM API directly. The LiteLLM API is documented here:
<https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/supported_endpoints>

```sh
# get spend ($) for your API key
export LITELLM_API_KEY="YOUR API KEY..."
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer ${LITELLM_API_KEY}" "http://litellm.dreamlab.ucsb.edu:4000/key/info?key=${LITELLM_API_KEY}" | jq .info.spend

# list available models
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer ${LITELLM_API_KEY}" http://litellm.dreamlab.ucsb.edu:4000/v1/models | jq .data[].id

```

## LiteLLM API with Python

This code is taken from the [LiteLLM documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/).

First, create a `.env` file in your project directory with your API key:

```sh
LITELLM_PROXY_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY..."
```

Then use the following Python code to connect to the gateway:

```python
import litellm
from litellm import completion
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# set custom api base to your proxy
litellm.api_base = "http://litellm.dreamlab.ucsb.edu:4000"

messages = [{"content": "Hello, how are you?", "role": "user"}]

# litellm proxy call
response = completion(
    model="litellm_proxy/gemini-3-flash-preview",
    messages=messages,
)
```
