RStudio is a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) for R
programming. Coder workspaces allow you to run RStudio Server, which
provides the full RStudio interface accessible through your web browser.

### Creating a Workspace with RStudio

When creating a new workspace, you need to enable the RStudio service to
make it available.

::: {.callout-note}
RStudio must be enabled when the workspace is created. It can't be added
to an existing workspace.
:::

1. Navigate to the "New Workspace" Page
2. Complete the required fields
3. Make sure "Include RStudio" is set to "Yes"
4. Complete the workspace creation process

Once your workspace has booted, you can start RStudio in a new browser
window using the button on the workspace dashboard.

## Setting Up an RStudio Project

RStudio Projects are used to organize your work and manage working
directories. Here's how to create a new project:

1. In RStudio, click **File** → **New Project**
2. In the New Project Wizard, choose "New Directory", to create a new directory
   for your project
3. For the project type, select "New Project"
4. Enter a name for the new directory: `my-project`. Leave "Create project 
   as a subdirectory of" set to `~`.
5. Click **Create Project**

RStudio will create a `.Rproj` file in your project directory. This
file stores project-specific settings and makes it easy to return to
your work.

## Installing R Packages

You can install packages in your workspace just like a local RStudio
installation:

```r
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggplot2")

# Install from GitHub
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("username/repository")
```

::: {.callout-tip}
Packages installed in your workspace persist across sessions but are
isolated from other workspaces. This ensures reproducibility and avoids
package conflicts.

## Setting Up Git

If you plan to use version control:

1. Open the Terminal in RStudio (**Tools** → **Terminal** → **New
   Terminal**)
2. Configure your Git identity:

```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
