title: Marimo Notebooks
---

Marimo is a Python notebook tool. Unlike Jupyter, marimo notebooks are stored
as plain Python files and automatically re-run dependent cells when a cell
changes. It also includes an AI coding agent that can be used with the [DREAMLab AI gateway](ai-gateway.html).

## Creating the workspace

Create a new workspace using the "New Workspace" form. You don't need to select
any of the optional settings (RStudio, VS Code etc).

## Install Marimo

Once the workspace has booted, open a Terminal window from the workspace
dashboard. Run the following commands ("`#...`" lines are comments):

```sh
# create a project folder and set it as your working directory
mkdir my-project
cd my-project

# create a python virtual environment for the project with uv
uv venv

# install marimo in the project
uv pip install marimo

# run this marimo server
uv run marimo edit --no-token --headless
```

The last command runs the marimo server in the context of the Terminal window.
(To quit the server, use `ctrl`+`c` or just close the Terminal window. For now,
keep it running.)


With the marimo server running, you can access the Marimo UI using the "port" menu from
the coder workspace dashboard. Click the port associated with "marimo" server.

### Marimo Interface

From the Marimo dashboard, you can create a new notebook, which will be saved in your project folder.


### Configuring the AI Provider

To use the dreamlab AI provider, you need to add a "custom provider". The
settings are:

- provider name: litellm_proxy
- base url: http://litellm.dreamlab.ucsb.edu:4000
- API key: your personal API key.

You also need to add the specific model you want to use. In "AI Models" tab,
click the "+ Add Model" button, select the Custom provider you just added and
then enter a model name. I am using `gemini-3-flash-preview`

The AI integration has two parts: there is a panel on the left side with a chat
interface (the chat has three modes: manual, ask, and agent); and in the main
notebook area, there is a "generate with AI button" -- using it, you can enter a
prompt to generate code for a new cell.


I've mostly been using the left-side chat interface in agent mode. What
differentiates agent mode from the others is that it has the ability to
add/modify/delete cells in the notebook.
