These tools, which generate and also execute code, can be useful but they are also inherently dangerous. “Prompt injection” attacks can trick AI tools into running nefarious code on your system. Because Coder workspaces are isolated virtual machines, the potential damage a rogue AI agent running in a workspace can cause is reduced (but not eliminated)."
