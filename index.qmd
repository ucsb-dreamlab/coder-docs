title: "Coder Workspaces: Overview"
---

Coder Workspaces are on-demand virtual machines with commonly used data
science tools pre-installed. Anyone with a UCSB Net ID can create a
workspace to use for the duration of the academic quarter. Workspaces are
deleted at the end of each quarter.

The service is managed by the [Library DREAM Lab](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/dreamlab) and uses
computing resources provided by the [College of Letters and Science IT](https://www.lsit.ucsb.edu)

### Creating a Workspace

1. Visit <https://coder.dreamlab.ucsb.edu>.
2. Click "UCSB Login" and log in using UCSB SSO (via Google).
3. Click the button to create a Dreamlab Workspace.
4. On the "Create Workspace" page:
    *  Give the workspace a name.
    *  Check "I understand the usage policies".
    *  Select additional software to enable (see below).
    *  Click "Create Workspace".
    *  It may take a few minutes for the workspace to boot.

You should see an interface for using the workspace (yours may be configured with slightly different software).

## Workspace Lifecycle

* Workspaces shut down (stop) after __four hours__ of inactivity.
* You can manually __stop__ a workspace by clicking the "stop" button.
* To __start__ a stopped workspace, click the workspace's "Start" button. It may take a few minutes to resume.
* Deleting a workspace deletes all files on the workspace!
* All workspaces will be deleted at the end of each academic quarter.

## Policies

* **Backup your data:** Data is not backed up; users are responsible for their own backups.
* **Deletion:** All workspaces are automatically deleted at the end of each quarter.
* **Limits:** Users may create and use only one workspace at a time. Multiple active workspaces may be deleted without notice.
* **Maintenance:** Workspaces may be inaccessible during scheduled maintenance windows (announced via email).
* **Inactivity:** Workspaces stop automatically after four hours of inactivity to conserve resources. They can be resumed by clicking the "start" button.
* **Software Installation:** Users may install additional software.
* **Access by Staff:** Workspaces may be accessed by staff in the Library or LSIT. Confidential or sensitive information should not be stored.
